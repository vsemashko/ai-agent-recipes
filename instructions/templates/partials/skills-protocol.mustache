### Skill Usage Protocol

**CRITICAL: Follow this workflow for EVERY task:**

1. **Pre-Task Check**: Before starting any task, scan the available skills list above
2. **Match Detection**: Identify if any skill is relevant to the current task based on its description
3. **Skill Activation**: If a match is found:
   - Read the full SKILL.md file at the specified path
   - Follow ALL instructions and best practices defined in that skill
   - Use any helper scripts or tools mentioned in the skill
4. **Multiple Skills**: If multiple skills apply, read and integrate guidance from all relevant skills
5. **No Match**: If no skill matches, proceed with standard approach
