## Agent Instructions Management

**IMPORTANT**: When working on projects that use Agent Recipes:

- Keep **AGENTS.md** as the single source of instructions for Claude Code
- All instruction updates, memory additions, and project-specific guidance should be added to AGENTS.md
- Do not duplicate or scatter instructions across multiple files
- CLAUDE.md (this file) contains high-level guidance and pointers
- AGENTS.md should contain all context and instructions for building features, fixing bugs, and understanding the codebase
